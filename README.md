Comic-ConX Web Project Overview:
Comic-ConX is a responsive website designed to promote India's greatest pop culture event featuring comic books, cosplay, live experiences, esports, and more. It allows users to explore different aspects of the event, view the gallery, provide feedback, and purchase event passes for various cities.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Structure of the webpage.
CSS: Styling of the page for responsiveness and visual appeal.
JavaScript: Used for dynamic content and interactions (e.g., slider).
